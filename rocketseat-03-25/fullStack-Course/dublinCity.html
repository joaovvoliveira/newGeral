      <h2>Discover 3 unmissable destinations from Dublin</h2>

        Dublin is a city rich in history, with attractions ranging from medieval
        castles to grand cathedrals and historic prisons. Whether you're
        exploring the cobbled streets of Temple Bar or diving into Ireland's
        past through its many museums, there is no shortage of things to see.
        Visitors can admire impressive architectural landmarks, learn about the
        city’s Viking roots, and walk through sites that have played a crucial

        <h3>Kilmainham Gaol</h3>
        <p>
          Kilmainham Gaol is one of Dublin’s most significant historical sites.
          Built in 1796, this former prison held many Irish revolutionaries,
          including leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising. A guided tour offers deep
          insights into Ireland’s struggle for independence and the harsh
          realities of life for prisoners. Walking through its eerie stone
          corridors is an unforgettable experience.

          fortress, it later became the seat of British rule in Ireland until
          1922. Visitors can explore the grand State Apartments, the medieval
          Undercroft, and the historic Chapel Royal, each telling a different
          story of Dublin’s past.
