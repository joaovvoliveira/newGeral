Advantages of Agile Methodologies:

${Scrum}

Divides work into iterations, called Sprints, lasting 2 to 4 weeks.

Defines specific roles for each person involved.

Has specific meetings such as Daily, Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, and Retrospective.

${Kanban}

Offers a continuous flow without fixed iterations.

Does not impose fixed roles, providing greater flexibility.

Focuses on visualizing the workflow through a Kanban board, representing process stages.

${Scrum_Methodology}

${Scrum_Guide_Changes}

Team reorganization into only three roles: Scrum Master, P.O., and Developers.

Teams can have up to 10 members in total.

Teams are now considered "Autonomous," responsible for managing their own work.

The Scrum Master takes on a leadership role, acting as a servant leader and guiding the team.

The P.O. can delegate responsibility (product backlog) since they are closer to the customer and understand priorities better.

${Scrum_Master_Responsibilities}

Leader, coach, and facilitator, ensuring Scrum implementation.

Removes impediments for the team, ensuring quality work.

Facilitates Scrum ceremonies, ensuring their effectiveness.

${P.O._Responsibilities}

Responsible for all Client-Team communication, understanding the client’s priorities.

Manages the Product Backlog and any changes to it.

Balances demands and conflicting realities.

Must always be available to the team.

Makes decisions and negotiates expectations with the client and internally.

Must be able to give and receive constructive feedback.

${Developers}

Need to embrace changes and adapt easily.

Focus on delivering quality work to the client.

Work effectively with other team members.

Share collective responsibility—no blaming individuals; responsibility belongs to the team.

Must be able to give and receive constructive feedback.

Ensure continuous client involvement throughout development.
