Functional Tests
	•	Defined based on the functional requirements of the software.
	•	Can be designed using test flows or decision tables according to the project’s business rules.
	•	Test Scenarios define what should be tested, while Test Cases define how, providing a step-by-step approach. Test cases are more detailed.
	•	Writing Test Cases using BDD (Behavior-Driven Development): BDD focuses on writing tests guided by user behavior and business logic. It follows the Given, When, Then structure.

QA Activities
	•	Testing
	•	Debugging and Logs
	•	Pair Programming
	•	Error Prevention

Agile Manifesto Principles for QA
	•	Test during development
	•	Prevent bugs
	•	Test understanding, not just functionality
	•	Build a better system
	•	Everyone is responsible for quality

Software Quality
	•	Defined a s a set of characteristics that ensure the product meets user needs creating the right software for the right user.
	•	In an agile team, QA professionals must take a generalist approach, looking at the software a s a whole to minimize costs, time, and unwanted effects as early as possible, contributing to a better project.

Development Approaches
	•	Waterfall Model: Development stages occur sequentially. Strong emphasis on analysis and design before implementation. However, testing happens only at the end, making error prevention difficult.
	•	Agile Models: Use an iterative approach, delivering functional components in smaller increments. The QA role is integrated throughout the development process.

Key QA Concepts
	•	Acceptance Criteria: Maximum or minimum values acceptable for a functionality to be approved.
	•	Definition of Done (DoD): A set of criteria determining whether a task is complete. It applies to the entire project.
